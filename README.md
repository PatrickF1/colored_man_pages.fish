This plugin installs a fish function wrapper around `man` that colorizes styled text (specifically underlined, bold, and standout) to make browsing man pages easier and more enjoyable.

The colors are added by setting environment variables that control how `less`, `man`'s default pager, processes styled text. Why use a wrapper to prepare environment variables when we could simply initialize environment variables on shell startup? Because the environment variables used contain escape sequences that will "overflow" into the output of other commands reading environment variables. See this [Stackoverflow question](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/87261/getting-unexpected-colorized-output-on-several-commands) for an explanation.

Credits: This idea was first inspired by [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_output_in_console#Using_less).

Note: [decors/fish-colored-man](https://github.com/decors/fish-colored-man) is a very similar plugin. What `colored_man_pages.fish` has but `fish-colored-man` does not:

- adds fish's man pages to MANPATH so users are able to read man pages for fish builtins
- includes a wrapper to also colorize the output of utilities that rely on less, such as `git help`

Conversely, `fish-colored-man` allows configuring colors but not `colored_man_pages.fish`.

## Install

With [Oh My Fish]

```fish
$ omf install https://github.com/patrickf1/colored_man_pages.fish
```

With [fisher]

```fish
$ fisher install patrickf1/colored_man_pages.fish
```

## Usage

Just invoke `man` as usual, but without changing the pager, to get colored output. For example

```fish
$ man less
```

To execute vanilla `man` without colored output, we can bypass the wrapper using `command`. For example

```fish
$ command man less
```

To colorize the output of utilities that rely on less, use the `cless` (short for colored less) wrapper to configure less before executing the utility.
For example

```fish
$ cless git help merge
$ cless git help log
```
